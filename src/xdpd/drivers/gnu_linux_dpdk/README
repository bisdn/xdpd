The GNU/Linux DPDK driver
==========================

Brief
-----

Platform driver backend using Intel's DPDK

Compilation
-----------

To compile xDPd you just have to specify the `--with-hw-support=gnu-linux-dpdk` option. DPDK will be compiled "on-board".

Note also that _before_ compiling, the file `src/config.h` should be revised to make sure that at least:

- `IO_IFACE_NUM_QUEUES`, `RX_XXTHRESH` and `TX_XXTHRESH` are correct according to your NIC's capabilities
- Core mask is at least 0x1 + 1 core, e.g. 0x3 (so 2 cores)

If you don't plan to use NF ports, so KNI or rte_ring ports, you can comment `GNU_LINUX_DPDK_ENABLE_NF` for a small extra-boost:

	//Enable NF extensions (KNI and secondary process DPDK ports)
	//#define GNU_LINUX_DPDK_ENABLE_NF


If you plan to use more than 4 KNI interfaces, please change:

	//Maximum number of KNI interfaces, used during preallocation
	#define GNU_LINUX_DPDK_MAX_KNI_IFACES 4

To execute xdpd use the normal configuration file (e.g. example.cfg). Note that DPDK's driver will discover 1G ports as `geXX` and 10G as `10geXX`.

Extra parameters, such as the coremask and the number of buffers can be specified using `--extra-params`. See FAQ.


Using xdpd+dpdk driver
----------------------

Before starting xdpd, three things must be done:

1. Set-up hugepages memory. Please refer to the DPDK manual for more information.
2. Load DPDK kernel modules:
  1. Load UIO default kernel module `modprobe uio`
  2. Load the IGB DPDK kernel module `insmod path_to_xdpd_folder/build/libs/dpdk/build/kmod/igb_uio.ko`
  3. [optional] If you use KNI interfaces `insmod path_to_xdpd_folder/build/libs/dpdk/build/kmod/rte_kni.ko`
3. Attach interfaces to the igb_uio kernel module. You can either use setup.sh script under `path_to_xdpd_folder/libs/dpdk/tools`, or use the shell script:

Simple script that does 2 and 3:

	#!/bin/sh

	## As discussed in 1.7.1 sect. 2.3.2.1 of the DPDK manual, reserve the hugepages memory at boot time.

	#user i/o
	modprobe uio

	#insmod DPDK kernel modules
	insmod <path_to_xdpd_folder>/build/libs/dpdk/build/kmod/igb_uio.ko

	#Optionally, if you use KNI
	insmod <path_to_xdpd_folder>/build/libs/dpdk/build/kmod/rte_kni.ko

	#Bind NIC by name
	<path_to_xdpd_folder>/libs/dpdk/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --bind=igb_uio eth1 eth2 eth3

	#Bind NIC by PCI address
	<path_to_xdpd_folder>/libs/dpdk/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --bind=igb_uio 0000:00:0b.0


Network interfaces
------------------

xDPd DPDK driver will discover 1G ports as `geXX` and 10G as `10geXX`. To list the discovered interfaces, you can boot xDPd with logging level `5` or more, or use the REST plugin or the CLI to list the available ports.:

	marc@dpdk:~/git/msune_xdpd/build/src/xdpd$ sudo ./xdpd -t -c example.cfg -d 5

DPDK version
------------

Current using v1.7.1 + KNI mempool patch (http://dpdk.org/dev/patchwork/patch/885/)


Limitations
-----------

Note that current config.h cannot handle multiple configurations of ports and RX/TX thresholds. This will be fixed in following version

FAQ
---

* Can I override the coremask or the pool size without recompiling? Yes, use the --extra-params option of xdpd like this:

        ./xdpd -c example.cfg -e "coremask=0x7;pool_size=65536"

* Why are some interfaces not recognised by xDPd? By default only tested devices are compiled by DPDK's PMDs; make sure all the device IDs are enabled when compiling DPDK. e.g. (E1000_DEV_ID_82583V): 

        diff --git a/lib/librte_eal/common/include/rte_pci_dev_ids.h b/lib/librte_eal/common/include/rte_pci_dev_ids.h

* Which interface names are used in gnu-linux-dpdk? `geXX` and `10geXX`. The discovered interfaces are listed on bootstrapping time.

* Why do I get the error 'PANIC in hal_driver_init(): Cannot init direct mbuf pool'? This is very likely due to insufficient hugepages memory. Try to increase the amount of hugepages memory. Alternatively you can reduce the amount of buffers allocated, by reducing `NB_MBUF` in `src/xdpd/drivers/gnu_linux_dpdk/src/config.h`.
